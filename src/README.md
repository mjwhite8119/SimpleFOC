# SimpleFOC Tests
This project is setup to do testing of the SimpleFOC library. The `main` branch uses the *SimpleFOCShield* together with an Arduino UNO.  The `SimpleFOCMini-ESP32` branch uses the *SimpleFOCMini* with an ESP32.  Testing on the Arduino UNO is limited to the size of the flash memory so most of the tests will be done on the ESP32.
